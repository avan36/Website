                they first scan a location QR code and then their container's box code. They then return this container to get back a credit. I worked on coding the front-end of this app and integrating it with Google Authentication via FirebaseAuth
                 and Firebase Real-time Database. I also implemented UserDefaults, AppStorage, Apple's location APIs for showing last scanned locations, and more. This was part of a group project, where I collaborated with others who delivered a backend server to generate QR codes.</p>

                Today, I was happy to complete my course, Supervised Machine Learning:
                Regression and Classification. This is a part of my Machine Learning
                Specialisation from Stanford Online – two more courses to go! I'm happy
                because I've been researching student use of Generative AI at the Wesleyan
                Assessment Lab, and now I can implement some machine learning models myself!

                I had a lot of fun presenting to Wesleyan's faculty on our research about
                student use of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23GenerativeAI&origin=GLOBAL_SEARCH_HEADER&sid=ox2" class="linkedin-post-hashtag">#GenerativeAI</a> last Thursday with Rena Chen, Veronica Goss,
                and Sadie Cook! We've been working on this project as part of the Wesleyan
                Assessment Lab since September under the guidance of Rachael Barlow.
                <br>
                <br>
                We surveyed 82 students from across 48 pop-up focus groups to learn how
                students are currently using AI in their academic/personal lives (e.g. content
                creation, revision of their writing) and why some students avoid it (e.g. fear of
                becoming reliant on it, skepticism about its abilities). Our findings reveal diverse
                student reactions to AI, and we're excited to work more in this area in the
                future!
