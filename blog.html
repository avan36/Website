              <section class="excerpt" itemprop="description">
                <p>I've been wondering recently about the future of software as Generative AI has become part of our thinking about the workplace. It seems to me that, throughout software companies' history, their moat has been time and technical know-how. For example, it would take many lifetimes to create the same software that Microsoft offers today, and it would require far more knowledge than any one individual could possess. Consequently, Microsoft has a moat around its products – they're hard and time-consuming to build. But here comes Generative AI, a new technology that can create virtually unlimited lines of code in no time, never gets tired, and knows a remarkable amount about coding.</p>
              
                <p>Of course, it would be impractical right now to, say, replicate a product like Microsoft Word using ChatGPT. How would you even go about that? For example, it's difficult in ChatGPT to handle multiple files, so you'd find yourself copying and pasting back and forth between the AI and the code editor. Of course, you could use a new IDE like Cursor, but even this has significant limitations on what you can build. Despite these current problems, it seems that someday (and we don't know when), AI will be both smart enough and cheap enough to build incredibly complex software all on its own. This software will require no technical expertise and very little time invested – a simple text prompt would suffice, and you could produce a whole application tailored to your needs.</p>
              
                <p>I don't mean to wax hyperbolic or be yet another writer glorifying humanity's "AI future." Instead, I'm speaking from a practical perspective – this technology will get cheaper, faster, and better. And this brings me back to my point: what is the future of software if AI can produce any code and act like an agent? Is there any future in producing code as a software developer if others can come along and essentially replicate your work in an instant?</p>
              
                <p>I'm reminded of the famous example of GPT-4 producing an HTML/CSS website simply from an image. I've tried this myself, taking screenshots of various websites and asking ChatGPT to replicate them – the results were impressive. Consequently, it seems that multimodal capabilities will accelerate the diminishing value of having source code if it can be reproduced instantly. Soon (and by soon I mean anywhere from 1 to 10 years), I'll be able to take a screen recording of, say, the Duolingo app and get a working demo of it, complete with generated source code. So is there any point in creating your own code? I'm honestly not sure.</p>
              
                <p>It seems one irreplaceable part of software will be the social features and network effects that have been built around them. For example, simply copying Facebook from a screenshot to create your own version would not be enough, as you wouldn't have all the content and the enormous friend graph from the network that makes a social network useful. Likewise, copying Netflix's user interface would not be useful, as you wouldn't have the actual video content available to stream (unless this content gets replaced by AI-generated video, but that's a tangent for another time). Consequently, some sites seem better suited to copying than others. Apps that merely provide a functional service or are involved in education without strong network effects seem like the first to go. Think apps like Duolingo or apps related to productivity, fitness tracking, or gaming.</p>
